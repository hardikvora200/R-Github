"If you read a lot of cell phone reviews, you see the reviewers get very nit picky in their comparisons of various phones because they have access to them all.You don't.All you want is the latest phone but not the stupid $1000 price for something you may drop on concrete and smash someday.The smart answer is a phone like this. Unless you're a teenage tech nerd, this phone will blow your mind with how well it performs in every way required by normal people.Everything works great. I think the camera is damn good. I'm not spending half my day posting selfies so other people will gratify my ego with 850 likes.With all the cloud storage available free today, you really don't even need the 128mb internal storage on this device but I bought it anyway.I've had 2 Huawei phones so far that were great. This new Chinese phone is better in every way.It supports fast charging but the included one doesn't so you need to pay another $20 to buy one. Otherwise, buy this phone.

"Loving it so far. Working on Metro in Texas DFW area. Phone supports bands 2 and 4 for T-Mobile and Metro for sure. Very happy with purchase.

"Got it as a gift and I love it! I never heard of it so I was worried but after I looked up info on maker etc I was blown away. My friends that have iPhone x are envious! They hate that I have better specs and this phone is a fraction of what they paid for their own..I really recommend it.

"I love this phone. It is absolutely worth the money. It works great in the Central Kentucky area with a Cricket sim card. I'm not a professional photographer but this thing takes great pictures, the bokeh is great in portrait mode. An $800 to $1000 phone may take better pics but for the money this has a great camera. The fingerprint sensor is very fast without any issues. It does have the capability of rapid charge but it doesn't come with a rapid charger, just a standard charger. The worst thing I can find with the phone is the battery life and I'm knit picking here. I'm am on the phone constantly through the day. So later in the evening (after about 12 or 13 hours) I sometimes have to give a quick charge to finish out the night. I would think with normal use you could go 1 1/2 or maybe 2 days per charge. AGAIN THIS DOES WORK IN THE USA, I HAD READ IN SOME PLACE THAT IT WOULDN'T WORK. IT DEFINITELY WORKS IN CENTRAL KENTUCKY WITH A CRICKET SIM.
            "
"Update: The phone just went completely blank today. It had more than 60% charge and no YouTube tutorial will even help me to get it back on. Rather disappointed but such is life. Amazon refunded me.I love the feel of the phone overall. What I don't like is how all the apps that are preloaded on the phone want so much permission in terms of access. The video is ok. The front camera is definitely an upgrade from my LG Stylo. For the 48mp (which you have to activate\" it does look good but I have some concerns in terms of the final quality. The speakers do not play music good. They seek extra sensitive. However, I give the phone a 4/5 star rating because as I said it surely is an upgrade from my last phone. But too much access to my privacy man. And the ads that pop up are annoying too.

"I love this phone *for the price* - you get a full 1080p screen, a whole lot of storage, a headphone jack (thank goodness.) But I take major issue with the camera, the way the camera is marketed, and its performance. Not to get too in depth here on technicalities, but we generally use a pattern in the world of imaging called a Bayer pattern. This alternated photosites between having a red, green, and blue filter over each, and the key is that no color next to each other is the same. That allows for processing called \"de-Bayering\" or \"demosaicing\" to resolve the image at one photosite per pixel. Well the \"48 megapixel camera\" camera may technically have 48 million photosites, but they're quadrupled up in color meaning you only get 12 megapixels of performance. In fact, due to spacing between photosites and how that limits light sensitivity, you actually get worse than the performance of a normal 12MP camera. This was clearly done mostly for marketing reasons which is really disappointing considering the image this makes isn't particularly great- and when you open up the camera app it looks like a joke to call it 48MP. A shame on an otherwise fantastic phone.

"Good phone great value works with metropcs in california. I get lte. Check the pics top left \"lte\"
            "
"I've been using the phone for 3 days now and I can definitely say it's an very impressive phone for a $200 budget level. Has good quality build and feel. Screen quality is great. The IMUI is ok but needs improvement. Adding a launcher will help but it's nothing to gripe about. I got the 128 gb rom which is pretty good for only $15 from the 64gb. As far as network, I'm still using my AT&T go phone Sim card and it's working fine.  Battery life is OK but with moderate use it could be better. I usually have to put on charge at the end of day. The camera takes great photos during daylight. Very crisp and detailed shots. The back is also glass so I would definitely use a case. Overall, very satisfied. I don't think anyone looking for a phone in this price range will be disappointed as it will compete with other phones at price levels in the $600-800+ range. Just be mindful of the network availability.

"Planning to buy Redmi 7? Read my review & decide yourself, if it satisfies your needs.Bought Redmi 7 in First sale, sharing my experience as below:Before that, if buying 2 GB, I'd suggest, at least go for 3 GB Ram variant by adding extra 1k, as in 2 GB MIUI is heavy, itself consumes more than 1 GB Ram.Box contains:- Handset,- 10 watt charger,- USB Cable,- Sim Insertion tool,- Back cover.Pros:- PERFORMANCE (4/5):  Snapdragon 632 Processor: Before this, on REDMI series SoC's were not that powerful, mostly using 4XX series, but now performance of SD 632 is good.- BATTERY LIFE (5/5):  4000 mAh: I just love Xiaomi, when it comes to battery performance, in moderate use which easily last for a day, In light usage, it lasts over a day and half. 7-8 hrs SOT. To charge from 0-100, it takes 2:20 hrs time.- CAMERA (4/5):  12MP+2MP Rear camera: which clicks above average pics in good lighting conditions. Colors looks natural.  8 MP Front Camera: Edge detection is good.  Camera2api support.- IR Blaster.- Dedicated SD card support, but still all apps are not movable to SD card.- Gorilla Glass 5, LED notification.- Dual VoLTE.- Fingerprint is fast & responsive.Cons:- Though PUBG works in medium setting, but it crashed few times. So, have to play in low settings.- Under direct sunlight, screen looks dull, even with 100% brightness.- Screen is HD+ 720p. Not Full HD.- Plastic body.- Low light camera performance is not upto mark.- No EIS (Electronic Image Stabilization).- Widevine level L3: no HD content streaming from Netflix/Amazon prime, but it's ok at this price range.- Ads ;) but you can turn it off, in setting, just turn off \"Show recommended content\".Still, Redmi 7 is good device which you can consider while buying for average daily usage.If you are tight on budget, it is value for money. You can buy it.Suggestion: If you can spend some extra amount, I'd suggest, Redmi Note 7 is far better than Redmi 7 at 10k, with Better SoC Snapdragon 660, Camera, Screen resolution, glass back, Quick charge.Other suggestions: Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2, Realme 3.---------------------------------------

"Planning to buy Redmi 7? Read my review & decide yourself, if it satisfies your needs.Bought Redmi 7 in First sale, sharing my experience as below:Performance: 4/5Battery: 5/5Camera: 4/5Display: 4/5Price: 4/5Pros:- PERFORMANCE:  Snapdragon 632 Processor: which offers good performance, even in multi tasking.- BATTERY LIFE:  4000 mAh: I just love Xiaomi, when it comes to battery performance, in moderate use which easily last for a day,. 7-8 hrs SOT. To charge from 0-100, it takes 2:20 hrs time.- CAMERA:  12MP+2MP Rear camera: which clicks above average pics in good lighting conditions. Colors looks natural.  8 MP Front Camera: Edge detection is good.  Camera2api support.- IR Blaster.- Dedicated SD card support, but still all apps are not movable to SD card.- Gorilla Glass 5, LED notification.- Red color looks really beautiful & stunning.- Dual VoLTE.- Fingerprint is fast & responsive.Cons:- Though PUBG works in medium setting, but it crashed few times. So, have to play in low settings.- Under direct sunlight, screen looks dull, even with 100% brightness.- Screen is HD+ 720p. Not Full HD.- Plastic body.- Low light camera performance is not upto mark.- No EIS (Electronic Image Stabilization).- Widevine level L3: no HD content streaming from Netflix/Amazon prime, but it's ok at this price range.- Ads ;) but you can turn it off, in setting, just turn off \"Show recommended content\".If buying 2 GB, I'd suggest, at least go for 3 GB Ram variant by adding extra 1k, as in 2 GB MIUI is heavy, itself consumes more than 1 GB Ram.Still, Redmi 7 is good device which you can consider while buying for average daily usage.If you are tight on budget, it is value for money. You can buy it.Suggestion: If you can spend some extra amount, I'd suggest, Redmi Note 7 which is far better than Redmi 7 at 10k, with Better SoC Snapdragon 660, Camera, Screen resolution, glass back, Quick charge.Other suggestions: Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2, Realme 3.---------------------------------------

Read my review & decide yourself, if it satisfies your needs.Bought Redmi 7 in First sale, sharing my experience as below:Before that, if buying 2 GB, I'd suggest, at least go for 3 GB Ram variant by adding extra 1k, as in 2 GB MIUI is heavy, itself consumes more than 1 GB Ram.Box contains:- Handset,- 10 watt charger,- USB Cable,- Sim Insertion tool,- Back cover.Pros:- PERFORMANCE (4/5):  Snapdragon 632 Processor: Before this, on REDMI series SoC's were not that powerful, mostly using 4XX series, but now performance of SD 632 is good.- BATTERY LIFE (5/5):  4000 mAh: I just love Xiaomi, when it comes to battery performance, in moderate use which easily last for a day, In light usage, it lasts over a day and half. 7-8 hrs SOT. To charge from 0-100, it takes 2:20 hrs time.- CAMERA (4/5):  12MP+2MP Rear camera: which clicks above average pics in good lighting conditions. Colors looks natural.  8 MP Front Camera: Edge detection is good.  Camera2api support.- IR Blaster.- Dedicated SD card support, but still all apps are not movable to SD card.- Gorilla Glass 5, LED notification.- Dual VoLTE.- Fingerprint is fast & responsive.Cons:- Though PUBG works in medium setting, but it crashed few times. So, have to play in low settings.- Under direct sunlight, screen looks dull, even with 100% brightness.- Screen is HD+ 720p. Not Full HD.- Plastic body.- Low light camera performance is not upto mark.- No EIS (Electronic Image Stabilization).- Widevine level L3: no HD content streaming from Netflix/Amazon prime, but it's ok at this price range.- Ads ;) but you can turn it off, in setting, just turn off \"Show recommended content\".Still, Redmi 7 is good device which you can consider while buying for average daily usage.If you are tight on budget, it is value for money. You can buy it.Suggestion: If you can spend some extra amount, I'd suggest, Redmi Note 7 is far better than Redmi 7 at 10k, with Better SoC Snapdragon 660, Camera, Screen resolution, glass back, Quick charge.Other suggestions: Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2, Realme 3.---------------------------------------

To charge from 0-100, it takes 2:20 hrs time.- CAMERA:  12MP+2MP Rear camera: which clicks above average pics in good lighting conditions. Colors looks natural.  8 MP Front Camera: Edge detection is good.  Camera2api support.- IR Blaster.- Dedicated SD card support, but still all apps are not movable to SD card.- Gorilla Glass 5, LED notification.- Red color looks really beautiful & stunning.- Dual VoLTE.- Fingerprint is fast & responsive.Cons:- Though PUBG works in medium setting, but it crashed few times. So, have to play in low settings.- Under direct sunlight, screen looks dull, even with 100% brightness.- Screen is HD+ 720p. Not Full HD.- Plastic body.- Low light camera performance is not upto mark.- No EIS (Electronic Image Stabilization).- Widevine level L3: no HD content streaming from Netflix/Amazon prime, but it's ok at this price range.- Ads ;) but you can turn it off, in setting, just turn off \"Show recommended content\".If buying 2 GB, I'd suggest, at least go for 3 GB Ram variant by adding extra 1k, as in 2 GB MIUI is heavy, itself consumes more than 1 GB Ram.Still, Redmi 7 is good device which you can consider while buying for average daily usage.If you are tight on budget, it is value for money. You can buy it.Suggestion: If you can spend some extra amount, I'd suggest, Redmi Note 7 which is far better than Redmi 7 at 10k, with Better SoC Snapdragon 660, Camera, Screen resolution, glass back, Quick charge.Other suggestions: Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2, Realme 3.---------------------------------------

Not Full HD.- Plastic body.- Low light camera performance is not upto mark.- No EIS (Electronic Image Stabilization).- Widevine level L3: no HD content streaming from Netflix/Amazon prime, but it's ok at this price range.- Ads ;) but you can turn it off, in setting, just turn off \"Show recommended content\".Still, Redmi 7 is good device which you can consider while buying for average daily usage.If you are tight on budget, it is value for money. You can buy it.Suggestion: If you can spend some extra amount, I'd suggest, Redmi Note 7 is far better than Redmi 7 at 10k, with Better SoC Snapdragon 660, Camera, Screen resolution, glass back, Quick charge.Other suggestions: Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2, Realme 3.---------------------------------------

Not Full HD.- Plastic body.- Low light camera performance is not upto mark.- No EIS (Electronic Image Stabilization).- Widevine level L3: no HD content streaming from Netflix/Amazon prime, but it's ok at this price range.- Ads ;) but you can turn it off, in setting, just turn off \"Show recommended content\".If buying 2 GB, I'd suggest, at least go for 3 GB Ram variant by adding extra 1k, as in 2 GB MIUI is heavy, itself consumes more than 1 GB Ram.Still, Redmi 7 is good device which you can consider while buying for average daily usage.If you are tight on budget, it is value for money. You can buy it.Suggestion: If you can spend some extra amount, I'd suggest, Redmi Note 7 which is far better than Redmi 7 at 10k, with Better SoC Snapdragon 660, Camera, Screen resolution, glass back, Quick charge.Other suggestions: Asus Zenfone Max Pro M2, Realme 3.---------------------------------------
